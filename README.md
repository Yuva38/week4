First steps
## checks for existing folder in the working directory, if there is no folder named "data", then it 
creates a folder named "data"
## download the file from the URL in a destination folder named "Dataset.zip"
## the https command gave me some error message so i did a google search. I found a suggesion
from the stack overflow to only use "http" and the command worked
##unziped the "Dataset.zip" folder which consists of a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset"
## the files inside the "UCI...." folder can be viwed with defining the file.path using the followng
 and list.files command
